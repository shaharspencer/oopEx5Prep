TO DISCUSS:
1) maybe limit the diff between consecutive floor blocks.

TODO:

Ideas for later:

1) Forcing "setTag" for all of our gameObjects.
instead of inheriting directly from GmaeObject, maybe we can create an abstract class that extends
gameObject and compels other classes that are extending it to have a set tag.
-- if we create a general instance of gameObject we will also need to change it to this class, so we will
probably need to use an anonymous class that extends our new abstract one instead of directly creating an
instance of GameObject.
