הסבר על ההבדלים בין שני תרשימי ה-UML .
//TODO WRITE THIS

o הסבר על האופן שבו הפכתם את העולם שלכם לאינסופי .

we made our world infinite using a class called InfiniteWorldManager. it has a method that update
in PepseGameManager calls to update the world using the avatar location.
we have a variable called buffer which defines the maximum amount the avatar is allowed to be
outside of in order for us to want to update the infinite world.
if we have exceeded this variable, by the avatar for example going right,
we want to add BUFFER amount of trees and blocks to the right of the current world,
and delete BUFFER amount of trees and blocks to the left of the current world.
in each of the classes Tree and Terrain, we have a linked list that holds a sorted list of
the blocks \ trees, from left to right. when we move right we add to the end of that list for
an Xrange of around BUFFER, and we remove from the beggining of that list around BUFFER amount.
each class, terrain and tree, is responsible when asked to delete from a specific x point to delete
all objects relating to itself: terrain holds columns (lists) of blocks and for each column removes all
blocks in that column, and the tree removes it's stump and it's leaves.
this makes it so the game only holds a relatively stable length of world and the game can run quickly.


o הסבר על הדרך שבה בחרתם לממש את החבילה trees ,ומדוע בחרתם דווקא בדרך זו.
we created a class tree that calls another class, SingleTree, each time it wants to create one tree
in a specific place. a SingleTree sprouts it's own leaves using a LeafFactory that chooses a color and
size for the leaf and returns a leaf to the tree.

since a leaf is a whole object of itself with it's own features and functionalities
we chose to create a seperate class for leaves.

//TODO - ELLI ADD MORE DOCUMENTATION FOR TREES



o הסבר על דילמות או החלטות עיצוביות שקיבלתם במהלך העבודה.
- we wanted to create a variety of different leaves color and size wise, since it's a whole object
of itself with it's own features and functionalities we chose to create a seperate class for leaves.
- we chose to create configuration files for classes, this is for readibility, for ease of reconfiguration
throughout the many files of the project and for consistency.


o אם בחרתם לממש בונוס, הסבירו מה היכולות שהוספתן וכיצד עשיתם זאת .
- we added a visual energy counter that shows how much energy the avatar has
- we added varying colors to the blocks, chosen randomly but remaining consistent as the world moves
left and right
- we added varying colors to the leaves, chosen randomly but remaining consistent as the world moves
                                         left and right
